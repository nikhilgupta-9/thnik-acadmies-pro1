# Task Manager (React + Vite)

This is a simple task manager project built using React and Vite. I created this to practice my frontend development skills and understand how to manage tasks in a real-world application.

## About the Project

The app allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete

I’ve used React for building the UI and Vite for faster project setup and development experience. The project is focused on functionality and clean structure.

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- Vite
- JavaScript
- CSS

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project locally

## Folder Structure
src/
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
├── components/
└── assets/


## Future Improvements

I plan to:

- Add local storage or backend integration
- Improve the UI with better styling
- Add task filters (like completed, pending)

## Author

This project is made by me as part of my learning journey.
